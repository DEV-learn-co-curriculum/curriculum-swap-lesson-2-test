## Technical Experience on Your Resume 

Without a doubt, the technical experience section is one of the most important parts of your resume. Interviewers will read this section carefully to gauge your skill set and determine how you'll be able to contribute to the team. In any hiring situation, interviewers want to know that you actually **can** do the job.

But don't be nervous, it's also the place where you get to show-off the application(s) you've built and display your technical chops.

## What Technical People Care About

In the land of programming, objectivity trumps subjectivity and specificity reigns supreme. That is to say, technical folk value specific contributions to a project and how those contributions played their part in the overall system.

When you describe your work, you always want to pinpoint **what technologies** you used and **why**. 

- Did you design/build the front end of your app? What technologies did you use? Likely HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
- Did you write all the API functionality using Ruby on Rails and the MVC pattern?
- Maybe you designed the database schema and coded all the DB logic. Did you use ActiveRecord and SQLite? Postgres?
- Did you make use of interesting/complex Gems? PG, Nokogori, and OAuth are typical fan favorites.

This applies to solo and group projects. If you collaborated with others, make sure you have a clear understanding of all components of the app including the features your partners built, what technologies they chose, and why. You’ll need to know this when it comes time to interview.

### Structure

In your `Technical Experience` section, the first thing you'll want to mention is the name of your app and a concise 1-2 line summary of your application. This is the sell so don't be afraid to spice it up a little.

### Examples
Here are some noteworthy examples from Flatiron grads who went on to create their own companies.

    StatusPage
    The best way to create a status page for your app or website. 
    
    GlossGenius 
    A smart, automated personal assistant software product for beauty professionals.
    
Next, you'll want to describe your (and your teammates’) contributions. Here, you'll typically want to include 3-5 bullet points discussing the what & why. 

Each bullet point follows a general pattern:
    
    [action verb] [specific technology] [action verb] [specific purpose]
    
### Examples

- Used Bootstrap and custom CSS to design front end
- Built APIs using Ruby on Rails and the MVC pattern
- Designed the database schema and configured ActiveRecord associations
- Configured ActionMailer to send confirmation emails
- Used OMniAuth for OAuth authentication with Facebook/Github
- Scraped Craigslist with Nokogori


Notice we leave the subjective language at the door. Nothing like:

- Used BootStrap and custom CSS to design a *beautiful* front end
- Scraped Craigslist *very quickly* with Nokogiri

Instead, there are no adorning adjectives or qualifiers here. It might be dry but it's also clear. That's what counts.

## End Result

If you put it all together, you'll end up with something like this:

    StatusPage
    The best way to create a status page for your app or website.
    - Used Bootstrap and custom CSS to design front end
    - Built APIs using Ruby on Rails and the MVC pattern
    - Leveraged jQuery and JavaScript for AJAX functionality

And that's it folks.

## Assignment 

Take a few minutes and reflect on the last application you built. Ask yourself the questions posed earlier:

- Why did you build it?
- What problem did it solve? 
- What technologies did you use?

Now, in your resume, adapt this information to the Technical Experience section for each of the applications you built or were involved in building.
